# AD FS to Azure AD application migration playbook for developers

This set of ASP.NET code samples and accompanying tutorials will help you learn how to safely and securely migrate your applications integrated with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This tutorial is focused towards developers who not only need to learn configuring apps on both AD FS and Azure AD, but also become aware and confident of changes their code base will require in this process.

These code samples are a companion to [Moving application authentication from AD FS to Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/migrate-adfs-apps-to-azure) available on the Microsoft Docs site.   

The folders in this repo are arranged as *chapters*, each with a README and sample code for a scenario. The chapters cover the most common types of authentication utilized by applications integrated with AD FS today, and we hope they let you learn and gain valuable experience before undertaking an app migration initiative for your applications currently running in production.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework)
- [AD FS](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/ad-fs-overview) environment
- [Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)

## Migration steps

By following the tutorial chapters in this code sample, you progress through the following scenarios:

- We start by integrating the provided sample web application with an AD FS instance. This web app uses the [SAML](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/single-sign-on-saml-protocol) protocol for it authentication setup. 
- Next, we'd migrate this application to an Azure AD tenant.
- Finally, we also provide instructions as how to change the authentication protocol from SAML to [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols). This change allows you to reap the benefits of accessing rich APIs like [Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/overview) and the [Azure REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azure/) amongst others.

We have also covered the following topics in some detail as they might play a big part in your app migration work:

- Configuring [Azure AD Connect sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-whatis).
- Migrating [Directory Extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-feature-directory-extensions) to Azure AD.
- Sync and use Security Groups on the migrated application.
